Episode is a local-first system that collects activity from cameras and other devices,
groups related events and evidence into self-contained incident records, and
coordinates actions such as recording and snapshot capture.

Episode uses ONVIF as its primary camera integration and keeps
Hikvision-specific inputs as optional enrichment. ONVIF event polling is
disabled by default because generic motion can be noisy; ONVIF discovery,
media profiles and RTSP remain available. It is intended for technical
self-hosters who want local, portable evidence.

## What it does

- Discovers ONVIF media profiles and can subscribe to motion and tamper events when enabled per device.
- Records from discovered RTSP streams and can optionally request ONVIF snapshots.
- Optionally enriches observations with Hikvision ISAPI and Alarm Server events.
- Preserves camera-created files through a generic FTP transport, then lets the
  configured Hikvision plugin interpret supported snapshot filenames.
- Preserves and checksums raw deliveries, snapshots, and recordings locally.
- Records every ingress delivery and deduplicates matching observations.
- Accepts normalized Events from trusted local automations through an optional
  raw-first HTTP Event API.
- Correlates observations from multiple cameras into Episodes.
- Starts and stops configured recordings around Episode activity.
- Reviews each Episode through a chronological Event timeline linked to its recordings and snapshots.
- Optionally projects vendor detection regions over snapshots and recordings without modifying evidence.
- Uses disposable presentation thumbnails in timelines and collection views without modifying original Evidence.
- Presents chronological Episodes, active camera views, Activity, Evidence,
  Devices, and system status in a web UI.

Episode does not currently provide authentication. Do not expose it directly to
the Internet. The Docker setup binds the web interface to localhost by default.

## Install with Docker

Requirements:

- Docker with the Compose plugin.
- A Linux user that can write to the project directory.
- ONVIF cameras for the primary live-ingestion path; the UI also starts without cameras.

The published image supports 64-bit Intel/AMD and ARM Linux hosts. Clone the
repository or download a release source archive, then prepare the local files:

```bash
cp episode.example.json episode.json
cp .env.example .env
mkdir -p data plugins
```

Replace the example FTP password in `episode.json` before allowing camera
access. Areas and Devices are configured in the web interface; the file now
contains only system-wide settings such as shared transports and action
defaults. Then start Episode:

```bash
docker compose --env-file .env pull
docker compose --env-file .env up -d
```

Open <http://localhost:8989>. A fresh installation opens the guided setup:

1. Create a physical Area that defines the correlation boundary.
2. Add a Device, choose its physical role, enter its address and credentials,
   then use **Validate and discover**. Episode reports protocol support
   independently from what is configured or currently running.
3. Select its capture behavior and integrations. Manufacturer, model, firmware,
   and media profiles discovered at runtime are shown read-only.
4. Save the Device. Episode activates its selected integrations immediately;
   the container does not need to restart.

Inspect service health with
`docker compose --env-file .env ps` and follow logs with
`docker compose --env-file .env logs -f episode`.

Stop it without deleting captured data:

```bash
docker compose --env-file .env down
```

The image version is pinned in `.env`. The commands pass that file explicitly to
Compose for `${...}` interpolation; it is not injected into the Episode
container. Episode reads shared service settings from the read-only
`episode.json` mount and stores UI-managed Area and Device inventory in SQLite.
During the pre-release lifecycle, database migrations are not guaranteed; a
release may require a clean database and will say so in its release notes. To
upgrade, change `EPISODE_IMAGE` to a new published version, review the release
notes, and run
`docker compose --env-file .env pull` followed by
`docker compose --env-file .env up -d`.

During shutdown Episode signals all active FFmpeg processes together and leaves
their HLS bundles explicitly recoverable. On startup, capture can continue in
the same logical recording bundle with a discontinuity marker when the Episode
is still active; otherwise the bundle is finalized as one Evidence item. Legacy
`.mp4.part` files are still reconciled as recording or incomplete Evidence.

### Area recording

Each video Device has a **Recording behavior** selected in the UI:

- `on_event` (default) records when that video device emits an active Event.
- `on_episode` records whenever any active Event opens or updates an Episode in
  the device's Area, including Events from doorbells and non-video sensors.

Each Device also has an **Episode activity window**. When that Device emits an
active Event, it guarantees that the Episode remains open for at least that many
seconds. Later Events may extend the deadline but never shorten it. Cameras that
join through `on_episode` follow the Episode deadline; their own window matters
only when they emit an Event themselves.

`episode_timeout` remains the fallback for Devices that do not yet have an
explicit activity window. Inactive observations are retained but never shorten
or extend the deadline, and duplicate connector deliveries do not start
recordings.

Recordings are captured as rolling HLS/fMP4 bundles. Each camera contributes one
logical Evidence item to an Episode, backed by a playlist, initialization file,
small immutable media fragments, and a checksummed component manifest. This
allows playback while an Episode is active without exposing camera credentials,
and keeps the whole recording portable inside its Episode folder.

`actions.recording.fragment_seconds` controls the target fragment duration
(default: 4 seconds). Camera keyframe intervals can make individual fragments
slightly longer. This setting affects playback latency and file granularity; it
does not limit the Episode or recording duration. Existing MP4 recordings remain
playable.

The UI uses native HLS where the browser provides it and a pinned hls.js light
build from jsDelivr as the fallback. The external script is protected by a
Subresource Integrity hash; browsers without native HLS require internet access
to load this fallback player.
H.264 video with AAC audio has the broadest browser support. HEVC/H.265 streams
are preserved without transcoding and play only where the browser and operating
system expose an HEVC decoder. A compatibility transcode or proxy would be a
separate presentation artifact, never a replacement for the preserved
recording.

### Network access

The UI/API binds to `127.0.0.1:8989` by default. FTP listens on port `2121` so
cameras on the local network can upload snapshots; passive FTP uses ports
`30000-30009`.

If cameras or local automation systems must push Alarm Server or Event API
deliveries to Episode, set the HTTP bind address in a local `.env` file:

```dotenv
EPISODE_HTTP_BIND=0.0.0.0
```

Only do this on a trusted network. Beta does not provide API authentication.

The [Event API guide](docs/EVENT_API.md) shows how Home Assistant, scripts, alarm
panels, and other local systems can trigger the same Area-scoped recording flow.

Start with the [ONVIF setup guide](docs/ONVIF_SETUP.md). Hikvision users can also
enable the [vendor-specific enhancements](docs/HIKVISION_SETUP.md).

Optional native integrations use the generic read-only `./plugins` mount.
HCNetSDK setup is covered alongside the other
[Hikvision enhancements](docs/HIKVISION_SETUP.md#hikvision-hcnetsdk); the SDK is
supplied by the user and never included in Episode's image.
Installed runtime files remain inactive until a Device explicitly enables the
matching integration configuration.

Beta supports explicitly configured third-party Device and ingress plugins
through the versioned plugin API v1 contract. The
[plugin authoring guide](docs/PLUGINS.md) documents manifests, lifecycle,
raw-first ingestion, scoped Device access, compatibility, and the included
dependency-free example. Third-party plugins are trusted code and are not
sandboxed.

### Troubleshooting

- If `./data` is not writable, set `EPISODE_UID` and `EPISODE_GID` in `.env` to
  the output of `id -u` and `id -g`.
- If a camera cannot upload over FTP, allow TCP 2121 and 30000-30009 between the
  camera network and the Docker host.
- If the UI works locally but cameras cannot send Alarm Server events, set
  `EPISODE_HTTP_BIND=0.0.0.0` and keep the host on a trusted network.
- Use `docker compose --env-file .env logs -f episode` to inspect integration and
  recording errors.
- Use **System → Recordings** to see active fragment progress,
  reconnecting streams, and recent incomplete captures. These diagnostics never
  expose camera stream URLs or credentials.
- Use **System → Download diagnostics** to attach a sanitized runtime report to
  an issue without exposing stored credentials or private data paths.

The [ONVIF troubleshooting guide](docs/ONVIF_SETUP.md#troubleshooting) contains a
more complete checklist.

## Data

Runtime data is written below `./data`. Each Episode folder contains its raw
event payloads, snapshots, recordings, an atomic `manifest.json`, and an
append-only `journal.ndjson`. The folder remains understandable if the SQLite
index is unavailable. Keep this directory backed up or synchronized separately.

Completed Evidence is immutable and indexed by checksum. An active HLS bundle is
working state until it is finalized and published as one Evidence item.
Interrupted bundles are reconciled on startup and are resumed, finalized, or
shown as incomplete Evidence rather than being silently abandoned. Legacy
`.mp4.part` captures follow a separate compatibility recovery path.

Episode automatically deletes managed visual Evidence after 30 days by default.
First-run setup requires an administrator to confirm that policy or explicitly
choose another period under **System → Storage**. Disabling
automatic deletion requires confirmation and leaves a persistent warning in the
UI. Cleanup runs at startup and hourly, removes original and derived visual files
together, and leaves an integrity-bearing expiration tombstone in the Episode.
Requirements vary by jurisdiction; exported files and external backups require
their own lifecycle policy.

Local `episode.json`, `.env`, and runtime data—including the SQLite-managed
inventory—are ignored by Git and must never be committed.

## Design principles

- Preserve raw inputs before parsing or processing them.
- Keep original evidence immutable and derived annotations separate.
- Record ingress deliveries as receipts; several receipts may describe one Event.
- Treat Episodes as interpretations and preserve how they were assembled.
- Keep connectors, correlation, and actions independently extensible.
- Prefer safe defaults, local operation, and recoverable data.

## Project status

Episode `0.1.0-beta.5` is a working ONVIF-first public beta for technical
self-hosters using IP cameras and Docker. Hikvision integrations provide
optional enrichment. The current priorities are reliable preservation, correct
correlation, simple installation, and an uncluttered Episode-first interface.

Authentication, action and processor plugins, AI processing, high availability,
and guaranteed compatibility with every ONVIF implementation are not part of
the current release. Beta supports Device and ingress plugin API v1 for the
duration of the beta cycle. Device capabilities are detected rather than
assumed.

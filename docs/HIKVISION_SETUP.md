# Hikvision setup

This guide covers optional Hikvision enhancements: ISAPI events, Alarm Server
deliveries, FTP snapshots, and the user-supplied HCNetSDK runtime. Configure the
primary camera path with the [ONVIF guide](ONVIF_SETUP.md) first. Menu names vary
by firmware.

## Before you begin

- Give the Episode host a stable address reachable from the cameras.
- Keep the cameras and Episode on a trusted network or isolated VLAN.
- Synchronize the Episode host, cameras, and NVR with NTP. Correlation depends on
  observation times being reasonably close.
- Do not expose Episode, FTP, RTSP, or camera administration directly to the
  Internet.

Copy `episode.example.json` to `episode.json` and replace its FTP password.
Areas, Devices, credentials, capture behavior, and Device integrations are
managed in the web interface. Device type describes the physical role—Camera,
Doorbell, Alarm panel, or Sensor—rather than the manufacturer. Hikvision appears
through discovered identity and optional ISAPI or HCNetSDK enhancements. Episode
uses the configured IP address to match incoming data; keep a Device's generated
ID and address stable after collecting evidence.

## Start Episode

```bash
cp episode.example.json episode.json
cp .env.example .env
mkdir -p data plugins
docker compose --env-file .env pull
docker compose --env-file .env up -d
```

Open <http://localhost:8989>, create an Area, and add the camera from the
**Devices** page. The System page reports core service and Integration health.
Saving Device changes activates its connections without restarting Episode.
Set the Device's **Episode activity window** to the minimum time an active Event
from that Device should keep its Area Episode and participating recordings open.

## ISAPI event stream

For enhanced vendor Event monitoring, edit the Device and select **Validate
and discover**. Episode safely requests Hikvision device information to verify
ISAPI independently from ONVIF. Enable **ISAPI Event stream** when supported,
then save the Device. Credentials entered for the
Device are shared with its enabled integrations and are never returned to the
browser.

Enabling ISAPI lazily activates the built-in Hikvision ISAPI Device plugin. The
core does not connect to or decode the vendor stream. The plugin connects to
`/ISAPI/Event/notification/alertStream` using the configured protocol, port,
path, and Digest authentication, then preserves every complete XML delivery
before interpreting it. Connection and authentication failures are isolated to
that Device and appear in the Device/System views and in
`docker compose --env-file .env logs -f episode`.

The ISAPI stream normally emits periodic status notifications. If an open
connection produces no bytes for 60 seconds, Episode treats it as half-open,
reports it as reconnecting, and establishes a fresh Digest-authenticated
stream. Diagnostics include the last stream activity and reconnect count.

## Alarm Server events

Alarm Server pushes require the camera or NVR to reach Episode's HTTP port.
Change `.env` on a trusted network:

```dotenv
EPISODE_HTTP_BIND=0.0.0.0
```

Restart Episode, then configure the camera's Alarm Server destination with:

- Host: the Episode host's LAN address
- Port: `8989`
- Path or URL: `/alarm` or `http://EPISODE_HOST:8989/alarm`, depending on firmware
- Protocol: HTTP

If an NVR sends events for several cameras, each event still needs an address or
channel identity that can be matched to a configured device. Episode records
each Alarm Server and ISAPI delivery separately and deduplicates matching
observations into one canonical Event.

The Alarm Server endpoint is a shared core HTTP transport. It stores the exact
request body before the configured Hikvision handler reads it; multipart
boundaries and any unrecognized parts remain in the immutable artifact. The
handler records normalized fields such as target type and bounding box as Event
metadata, so UI overlays never modify the source XML or image.

The default maximum Alarm Server request is 16 MiB. It can be changed on the
connector with `settings.max_payload_bytes`; oversized requests are rejected
with HTTP 413 before plugin handling.

## FTP snapshots

The example configuration enables an FTP server with:

- Host: the Episode host's LAN address
- Port: `2121`
- Username: `episode`
- Password: the value you set in `episode.json`
- Passive TCP ports: `30000-30009`

Configure event-triggered picture uploads in the camera or NVR. Allow TCP 2121
and 30000-30009 through host and network firewalls. Do not reuse the example
password.

FTP is a vendor-neutral transport in Episode. It first preserves and checksums
every file, then the configured Hikvision FTP plugin recognizes supported
camera and video-intercom filenames and creates snapshot Evidence. Unknown or
malformed filenames remain visible as raw deliveries instead of being deleted.
The source address and filename metadata help associate a recognized snapshot
with its Device and nearby Event. The received bytes are preserved unchanged;
bounding boxes and future annotations remain separate metadata.

The System page reports the FTP listener and upload counts separately from the
Hikvision FTP snapshot interpreter. A failed interpreter degrades its plugin
status without stopping FTP or discarding the preserved upload.

The Episode timeline shows every snapshot, including unmatched files. When an
annotated target Event and consecutive `MD_WITH_TARGET` snapshots form a
continuous sequence, the UI can carry the latest detection region through that
sequence and update it when a newer Event arrives. A timing gap ends the derived
track. This affects review overlays only and never changes evidence or stored
Event relationships.

## Recording and ONVIF

Episode normally discovers the RTSP URI and snapshot endpoint through ONVIF. A
manual `video` configuration remains a fallback for devices with incomplete
ONVIF media support. Hikvision's common main-stream path is
`/Streaming/Channels/101`; channel `102` is normally a lower-bandwidth stream.

Keep the camera's ONVIF service enabled and use **Digest & WS-Username Token**
authentication. See the [ONVIF setup guide](ONVIF_SETUP.md) for the primary
configuration and profile selection.

## Hikvision HCNetSDK

Episode can discover and validate an optional Hikvision HCNetSDK installation.
The SDK remains user-supplied: Episode does not download, redistribute, or add
vendor binaries to its container image.

Episode validates HCNetSDK, then starts one isolated worker process for each
device that explicitly enables the capability. Each worker logs in on the SDK
service port and subscribes to alarm callbacks. A native crash affects that
device worker, not the Episode server or other devices.

Every callback buffer is preserved as an immutable raw delivery. Episode also
interprets narrowly validated video-intercom callbacks emitted by supported
Hikvision devices:

- `COMM_ALARM_VIDEO_INTERCOM` (`0x1133`) subtype `17` creates an active
  canonical `doorbell` Event;
- subtype `18` creates the matching inactive doorbell observation;
- `COMM_UPLOAD_VIDEO_INTERCOM_EVENT` (`0x1132`) unlock records create
  `door_access` Events with the reported method, lock and embedded-picture
  fingerprint. HCNetSDK does not report the unlock outcome, so Episode does
  not claim that the door successfully opened;
- unknown commands and subtypes remain raw-only and never create guessed Events.

Doorbell JPEGs delivered separately through FTP are preserved as Episode
evidence but marked as event attachments, so they are not used as timelapse
frames.

An active doorbell Event enters the normal Area-scoped action flow. A doorbell
using **Own Events only** records its own stream, while video Devices in the
same Area using **Any Episode in this Area** join the same Episode.

### Activate the plugin

Installing SDK files alone does not activate or load the integration. HCNetSDK
is currently exposed for Doorbell Devices, where its callback flow has been
validated. Edit the Doorbell, enable **HCNetSDK**, set its login port (default
`8000`) under manual connection overrides, then save the Device. The backend
plugin contract does not impose that Device-type limitation.

The Device name, Area, IP address, username, and password are required.
Credentials are sent to the isolated worker over standard input; they are not
included in process arguments, Integration status responses, or routine logs.
If no Device enables HCNetSDK, its Python module and native runtime remain
unloaded. This keeps optional integrations lazy as the plugin catalog grows.

### Install the SDK files

1. Open [Hikvision's official HiTools download page](https://www.hikvision.com/europe/support/tools/hitools/?type=IP)
   and download the Linux 64-bit HCNetSDK package that matches your host
   architecture. Hikvision requires you to accept its download and licensing
   terms.
2. Extract the archive outside the Episode repository.
3. Copy the complete contents of the SDK package's `lib/` directory:

```bash
mkdir -p plugins/hikvision-sdk
cp -a /path/to/EN-HCNetSDK*/lib/. plugins/hikvision-sdk/
docker compose --env-file .env up -d
```

Copy the whole `lib/` directory contents, including `HCNetSDKCom/`. Copying only
`libhcnetsdk.so` is not enough. The resulting layout starts like this:

```text
plugins/
└── hikvision-sdk/
    ├── libhcnetsdk.so
    ├── libHCCore.so
    ├── libhpr.so
    └── HCNetSDKCom/
        └── libHCAlarm.so
```

The SDK architecture must match the container host: use an x86-64 SDK on
`amd64`, or an AArch64 SDK on `arm64`. Episode checks the ELF architecture
before any native library is loaded.

### Verify the SDK

Open Episode's **System** page and find **Integrations**. A working install
shows `Hikvision HCNetSDK`, its SDK version and architecture, plus one health
entry per configured device. It includes connection state, preserved
notification count, and last notification time. The same state is available from:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8989/api/v1/plugins
```

Normal plugin and worker lifecycle messages use Episode's main container log.
HCNetSDK's own diagnostic file logging is not enabled, and no files are written
into the read-only `plugins/` mount.

The reported states are:

- `not_installed`: the plugin is configured but its SDK directory is absent;
  Episode runs normally.
- `incomplete`: required runtime files or `HCNetSDKCom/` are missing.
- `incompatible`: the SDK is not a supported 64-bit ELF library or its CPU
  architecture does not match the host.
- `validating`: the isolated validation process is running.
- `ready`: validation succeeded and every configured device worker is connected.
- `degraded`: at least one device worker is connected and at least one is not.
- `failed`: validation failed, or no configured device worker is available.

Validation runs in a disposable child process, and each configured SDK device
runs in its own long-lived child process. A broken library or native crash
changes plugin health but does not stop Episode. Failed login and subscription
attempts are not automatically retried in a tight loop, avoiding accidental
device lockouts; correct and save the Device configuration again.

Every successfully copied callback buffer is initially sealed below
`data/orphans/plugin-deliveries/hikvision-sdk/<device-id>/` and registered as an
accepted ingestion receipt. When an explicitly supported callback creates an
Event, Episode links the receipt and moves the sealed artifact into that
Episode's `events/` directory. Uninterpreted callbacks remain in the orphan
location for future inspection and reprocessing.

## Verify the flow

1. Open the Episode System page and confirm the expected integrations are healthy.
2. Trigger one configured camera event.
3. Watch `docker compose --env-file .env logs -f episode` for a canonical Event
   and Episode.
4. Open the new Episode and confirm its Events, receipts, snapshots, and
   recording.
5. Inspect `data/episodes/<episode-id>/manifest.json` to confirm the portable
   relationships and SHA-256 checksums.

Several receipts for one Event are expected when ONVIF, ISAPI, and Alarm Server
observe the same activity. They demonstrate provenance rather than duplicate
incidents.

## Troubleshooting

### The UI is reachable only from the Docker host

This is the safe default. Set `EPISODE_HTTP_BIND=0.0.0.0` only when LAN devices
must reach the Alarm Server endpoint or you intentionally want LAN UI access.

### FTP connects but uploads fail

Check the passive port range as well as port 2121. Verify that Docker publishes
30000-30009 and that no host firewall blocks the camera subnet.

### Events arrive but snapshots do not correlate

Confirm that the camera's source IP matches the device `ip_address`, check NTP on
all devices, and inspect the FTP filenames in the logs. Preserve the original
files when reporting a reproducible parser problem, but never attach private
evidence to a public issue.

The review timeline deliberately leaves snapshots unmatched after a break in
target observations. This prevents an old bounding box from being presented as
current merely because another image arrived later.

### Recording does not start

Test the configured RTSP address and credentials from the Episode host. Check
that the camera permits another concurrent stream and inspect FFmpeg errors in
the Episode logs.

### Permission denied below `data`

Set `EPISODE_UID` and `EPISODE_GID` in `.env` to the host user that owns the data
directory, then restart the container.

### A restart interrupted a recording

Current recordings use recoverable HLS bundles. Episode preserves completed
fragments during shutdown and startup. If the persisted Episode is still active
and its recording target can be reconstructed, capture resumes in the same
logical Evidence bundle with a playlist discontinuity. Otherwise Episode
finalizes the usable fragments as recording Evidence or reports the capture as
incomplete. A restart may still create a capture gap or lose the fragment that
was being written; it does not rewrite earlier fragments to conceal that gap.

Legacy `.mp4.part` captures are probed separately on startup. A playable file is
recovered as recording Evidence; an invalid partial remains visible as
incomplete Evidence. Review **System → Recordings** and keep the surrounding
logs when reporting a reproducible recovery problem.
